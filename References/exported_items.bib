	abstract = {The standard social discount rate of 12\% applied by planning institutions and multilateral agencies when evaluating public projects is a constant administrative parameter that is unsupported and unresponsive to changes in social preferences over time. This paper presents an alternative way of determining the social discount rate based on the gamma estimation model (Weitzman, 2001) in a developing-country context, which has three advantages: (i) it incorporates decreasing discounting, (ii) it is cost-efficient in that it sums up the various expert opinions and (iii) it adjusts for changes in short- and long-term preferences. Our estimates are lower than the standard nominal rate for different time periods, ranging from 2\% for evaluation horizons longer than 51 years to 11\% for the short term (0–5 years).},

	abstract = {Farmer-led irrigation development (FLID) is not a new phenomenon and has been happening throughout the centuries in all countries where irrigation is practised. Despite this, planners, policy makers, funders, including engineers have generally taken the perception that irrigation development occurs mainly in “irrigation schemes”. Although farmer-led irrigation happens in formal irrigation schemes, there is a substantive amount of irrigation development implemented quietly by self-motivated individual farmers on their own initiatives. Such irrigation remains unrecognized, un-recorded and thus ignored in the realm of the irrigation sector decision-makers. The term FLID was coined just recently in 2017, and through it, there is emerging a wealth of knowledge on the technologies, practices, economic, marketing, financing and social components regarding how this sub-sector operates. Indeed FLID is not tacitly captured in Kenya’s policies, statutes and development plans. Its extent is largely unknown since it has not been targeted in any mapping exercise. Yet, as irrigation transitions more from public to private investment, FLID is the next big thing pushing the growth of irrigation in Kenya. This paper therefore highlights some of the salient features of FLID, a sub-sector of interest towards enhancing irrigation development and food security in Kenya.},

	abstract = {Multifunctional landscapes are used and shaped by a range of different stakeholders. The high number of diverging values, interests or demands in such landscapes can lead to conflicts that impact sustainability goals. In this study, our aim was to include stakeholders’ valuations of ecosystem services in multifunctionality assessments and thereby to identify different and possibly contradictory perspectives on landscape multifunctionality. Two European cultural landscapes, the Vereinigte Mulde (Germany) and the Kromme Rijn (The Netherlands), were used as case studies. Spatially explicit indicators of eleven ecosystem services were assessed and weighted according to their survey-based perceived importance for different stakeholder groups. While some significant differences between the groups were apparent, the results also revealed that all stakeholder groups acknowledge the importance of multiple ecosystem services. Stakeholder-specific multifunctionality hotspots occurred mainly in forests or grasslands and largely overlapped between the groups. Our study therefore clearly shows that the diversity of ecosystem services must be preserved in order to preserve the values that cultural landscapes offer to a wide range of people. While local solutions must be sought to resolve local land use conflicts over the use of ecosystem services, we conclude that multifunctionality can be declared a common goal.},

	abstract = {The modernization efforts of the irrigation subsector in Kenya have been hampered by several challenges. This review describes the status and challenges facing irrigated agriculture in Kenya. The results indicated that as of 2018, the developed irrigation schemes covered an area of 222,240 ha, which is 16\% of the irrigation potential of 1.34 million ha. Most large-scale irrigation schemes use the furrow system. Private and commercial farms and smallholder irrigation schemes use modern irrigation systems. The major challenges to irrigation development are technical, socio-economic, and institutional. The main technical challenges include poor water infrastructure, water scarcity, and poor water quality. The main socio-economic challenges include the high cost of modern irrigation systems, inadequate credit facilities, and market inaccessibility. The institutional challenges include the existence of a pluralistic legal framework, inadequate participation by farmers, including women farmers, and poorly organized irrigation water user associations. However, the future of irrigation development is bright through climate change adaptation strategies such as solar-powered irrigation systems and rainwater harvesting.},
